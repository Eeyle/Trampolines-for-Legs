Trampolines for Legs is a personal project about turning movement into something fun and engaging again. The central mechanic is that the player can rebound by jumping again as soon as they hit the ground, up to nearly the same height they were before. The purpose of the game is to bounce around huge 3D spaces rising higher and higher, with your jumps becoming longer and ever-more dangerous.

The source code for this game can be found [on github](https://github.com/Eeyle/Trampolines-for-Legs/). The game runs in the open-source [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/). Gameplay programming is written in C# using [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/), while the shaders use Godot's built-in shading language, derived from [GLSL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language).
