jump up something
jump over something

jump which is too long and tall to make normally, which you can only make by rebounding
double rebound jump

jump which is too tall, but with no rebound potential, so you have to wall jump climb it
jump which can only be made by wall jump

wall jump + rebound
final challenge for the two mechanics: make three wall-jump -> rebounds in a row





room zero
	jump up something tiny
	jump over something short

room one
	rebound over something
	rebound twice
	
room two
	wall climb
	wall jump turn

room three
	wall jump + rebound (longest corridor)
	(wall jump + rebound) * N
